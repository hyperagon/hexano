# Hexano
A simple hexagonal piano.

- Vibe coded but it required me to correct the *CSS* and change some thing on the controls.
- Everything is packed into a single *HTML* file
- Let's you pick different kinds of Wave
- Records the output into a *WAV* file
- Replays what was recorded like a piano roll
