# Hexano
A simple hexagonal piano.

- Vibe coded but it required me to correct several things
- Everything is packed into a single *HTML* file
- Let's you pick different kinds of Wave
- Records the output into a *WAV* file
- Replays what was recorded like a piano roll
- Can Import and Export a melody to a *JSON* file
